This is the primary dependency for testing you will require for your Spring Boot application; think JUnit tests.

By automating tests and incorporating them early on in your application, you can ensure that subsequent builds and changes made don't break existing functionality. 

Ofcourse, any functionality that has been change would require the test cases to change as well. 

### Example (Maven Dependency):
```:
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-test</artifactId>
    <version>2.3.4.RELEASE</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```
